<p>
    For speedy editing, it is recommended to use the keyboard while creating your patterns. You can use the arrow
    keys to switch pattern and channel positions and use <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the param automation editor, or <strong>ctrl + ENTER</strong> to open the
    note entry editor.
</p>
<p>
    You can also play notes instantly by using the following keyboard keys:<br /><br />
    <strong>&nbsp;S D   G H J   L ;<br />
    Z X C V B N M , . /</strong><br /><br />
    ...which mimic the layout of a 1.5 octave piano keyboard. You can adjust the root octave by using the <strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong> keys.
    By either clicking the record button in the transport controls or by using <strong>ctrl + R</strong> to toggle the recording mode, you can add the notes directly into the currently selected pattern.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>K</strong>-key inserts an "off"-instruction (kills previously playing note) while hitting <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> toggles the play state of the sequencer.
</p>
<h4>Selections and copy / paste</h4>
<p>
    If you hold down <strong>shift</strong> while using the arrow keys (or mouse), you can make a selection. To copy a selection,
    press <strong>ctrl + C</strong>, press <strong>ctrl + V</strong> to paste and <strong>ctrl + X</strong> to cut selections. You can paste
    selections across the available channels.
</p>
<h4>Undo / redo</h4>
<p>
    efflux stores 99 states in its internal history. You can use <strong>ctrl + Z</strong> to undo and
    <strong>ctrl + shift + Z</strong> to redo a state.
