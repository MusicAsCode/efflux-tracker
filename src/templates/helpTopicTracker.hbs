<h4>Tracker help</h4>
<p>
    For speedy editing, it is recommended to use the keyboard while creating your patterns. You can use the arrow
    keys to switch pattern and channel positions and use ENTER to toggle the note entry editor. The "O" key inserts
    an "off"-instruction (kills previously playing note). Spacebar toggles the play state of the sequencer.
</p>
<h4>Selections and copy / paste</h4>
<p>
    If you hold down <i>shift</i> while using the arrow keys, you can make a selection. To copy a selection, press
    <i>ctrl + C</i>, press <i>ctrl + V</i> to paste and <i>ctrl + X</i> to cut selections. You can paste
    selections across the available channels.
</p>
<h4>Undo / redo</h4>
<p>
    zTracker stores 99 states in its internal history. You can use <i>ctrl + Z</i> to undo and
    <i>ctrl + shift + Z</i> to redo a state.
