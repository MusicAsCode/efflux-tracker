<h4>Pattern properties</h4>
<p>
    Your composition can contain up to 255 patterns. To speed up proceedings, you can
    copy a pattern (this copies both channels), and paste them into another pattern (pasting does
    not clear existing pattern content, only overwrite overlapping notes).
</p>
<p>
    When adding a pattern, it is inserted after the currently active pattern. As such it is possible
    to add patterns in between existing parts of your composition.
</p>
<p>
    Patterns can have a 16- to 128-step precision. You can switch between these on an individual pattern
    basis. 16 steps are great for sketching rhythmic accents while 64 steps are good for creating arpeggios to
    imply chord outlines.
